Graphical User interface - GUI :

Create a file [list.txt] and add content??    
=========================================
1. Simon 
2. Legah 
3. Landmark 
4. Dominion 
We shall use the vi command:
  vi list.txt 
vi has 'insert' mode and 'command' mode:

1. You start accessing the file in command mode 
   In command mode we can't modify content
     press the 'i' key to enter "insert" mode 
     press "esc key" to enter command mode 

2. Save and Quit: 
    1. press "esc key" to enter command mode 
    2. type ':wq' or ':wq!' and press enter-key 
       to save and quit

3.  Quit without saving:  
     press "esc key" to enter command mode          
     type ':q!' and press enter key to quit 
     without saving

 short-cut -- Save and Quit: 
    press "esc key" to enter command mode
    do a quick double press on the shift+z key  
    to save and quit = press+hold '

Modifying the content of a file:
  Text editors:
 Windows:
    sublime text
    bracket
    notepad++
    vs code 
    atom 
    eclipse
